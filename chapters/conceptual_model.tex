\chapter{Conceptual Model}\label{chap:conceptual_model}

In this chapter you must explain, using the information from the previous two chapters and critical thinking, the most likely solution to your problem definition (narrowing down the theories and research), resulting in a final theory and/or model. Under a conceptual model it is understood that:  the author first investigates which factors play a role, and then provides argumentation for the identification of the most important ones. This chapter is basically a summary of chapter 2 and should be roughly 1 page long.
