\section{Monte Carlo Method Analysis}

The Monte Carlo Method (MCM) analysis focuses on the output derived from two distinct locations: the Lab and Home. Due to the differences in size between these locations, the distances between devices as input parameter vary, as illustrated in figures \ref{fig:distance_matrix_lab} and \ref{fig:distance_matrix_home}. In the following tables, only the last 5 iterations of the MCM output are presented, as space limitations in this research paper prevent the inclusion of all iterations, which can number in the thousands. For a comprehensive list of the data table, refer to the appendix. The full list of parameters used for the MCM analysis can be found in table \ref{tab:monte_carlo_parameters}.

The last row in each table indicates a penalty value of 0, which satisfies the mathematical constraints. When a constraint violation occurs, a penalty value of 1000 is added to the Penalty column. An optimal network configuration, which comprises different device types and initial transmission power, is represented by the absence of a penalty. Table \ref{tab:monte_carlo_results_lab} shows the MCM output from the lab location, where the final row demonstrates an optimal network configuration, with a penalty value of zero. Similarly, table \ref{tab:monte_carlo_results_home} presents the MCM output from the home location, with the last row indicating an optimal configuration, also featuring a penalty value of 0.

Examining the rows with penalties in both tables, we can take the first row as an example. In this row, the penalty value is 3000, indicating three violations. According to the mathematical constraints, a leader router must be present in the network, represented by the number 4 in the device column. The absence of a leader router results in the first violation, adding 1000 to the penalty. The relevant mathematical constraints and models are detailed in equations \ref{eq:minimize_power}, \ref{eq:mathematical_constraints_end_device}, \ref{eq:mathematical_constraints_router}, and \ref{eq:mathematical_constraints_border_router}.

The next constraint requires the number of routers and leaders to be equal to or greater than 3. However, the network configuration in the first row lacks a leader, leading to another violation. Lastly, a constraint mandates that the number of REEDs must be equal to the combined number of routers and leaders. The absence of a leader router in the network configuration causes the penalty value to reach 3000. The Monte Carlo Method continues iterating until it identifies an optimal network configuration without any constraint violations.


\section{Genetic Algorithm Analysis}

Similar to the Monte Carlo Method Analysis, the tables presented below display the output from the Genetic Algorithm for both lab and home locations, with the primary difference between the two scenarios being the distance between devices as input parameters. Unlike the MCM, GA directly provides the final result, showcasing the lowest feasible transmission power without any constraint violations. As GA emphasizes minimizing transmission power, storing all analyzed data from its output is unnecessary, except for the final result. The full list of parameters used in the GA analysis can be found in table \ref{tab:ga_parameters}.

\begin{longtable}{>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.298\linewidth}>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.54\linewidth}>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.087\linewidth}}

  \hline

  \hline\hline
\end{longtable}

  \caption{Genetic Algorithm output from home.}\\

  \hline
  5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2 & -20, -19, -20, -19, -18, -18, -16, -19 & -149   \\
  \hline\hline
\end{longtable}

The Genetic Algorithm output for the lab location, as shown in table \ref{tab:ga_results_lab}, achieved the lowest possible transmission power of -20 $dBm$ for all nodes in the network. This outcome is expected, given the network's short distances within the small lab setting. When devices are in close proximity to each other, there is no need to increase transmission power, as doing so would waste energy. In this scenario, GA successfully minimized transmission power for all nodes. Although it may appear that GA could have set the power even lower, it's important to note that -20 $dBm$ is the lowest limit, and going below that would depend on the mathematical constraints covering path loss and RSSI sensitivity.

Conversely, table \ref{tab:ga_results_home} displays the GA output for the home location, where transmission power was not set to the lowest possible value for all nodes due to the larger area. The GA output produced a transmission power range from -16 to -20 $dBm$, which is still an impressive result compared to the maximum transmission power mode. This variation in transmission power reflects the differing distances between devices within the home network.

Lastly, the device columns display the same types of devices, which is due to the total number of devices being set to 8, as specified in the parameters table \ref{tab:monte_carlo_parameters}. According to the mathematical constraints, this represents the optimal network configuration derived from the MCM output. If the total number of devices in the network were to be increased, the network configuration would exhibit greater variation.

In addition to these results, examining the plots for both the lab and home locations provides further insight into the transmission power optimization process based on the number of generations. The X-axis of the plots represents the total number of populations, with 100 max populations being set for this research, as mentioned in the parameters table \ref{tab:ga_parameters}. The maximum number of populations is adjusted depending on the optimization process and requirements. The linear curve observed in the plots is influenced by the parameters used in the GA process, such as distances between devices and the selection method. As these factors change, the transmission process is affected, resulting in different curve patterns in the plots. This demonstrates the flexibility of the GA in adapting to various network configurations and optimization objectives.

\section{Distance vs. Transmission Power Analysis}

Understanding the relationship between distance and transmission power in the network is important for analyzing network configurations. By looking at the plots for both lab and home locations, this relationship becomes clearer. In these plots, the distance between devices is shown on the x-axis, while transmission power is displayed on the y-axis.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}

      \label{fig:home_distance_vs_txpower_mcm}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}

      \captionof{figure}{Transmission power vs. distance for lab location using GA.}

      \captionof{figure}{Transmission power vs. distance for home location using GA.}
      \label{fig:home_distance_vs_txpower_ga}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

A closer look reveals that as the distance between devices increases, transmission power also increases. Conversely, devices closer to each other have lower transmission power settings. This pattern is expected because it is inefficient to use extra power for devices that are near each other. Instead, higher transmission power is needed to keep devices connected when they are farther apart.

Transmission power plays a key role in determining the coverage of Thread radio networks. Networks with higher transmission power settings can cover larger areas, ensuring that devices stay connected even when they are separated by greater distances \cite{sheth2002implementation}. Effective power management is important for optimizing network performance and saving energy.


\section{Path Loss Analysis}

The relationship between path loss, distance, and environment is a critical aspect of wireless communication. Two plots are provided to illustrate the path loss between devices at both lab and home locations. As anticipated, these plots demonstrate that the greater the distance between devices, the higher the path loss. It is important to note that even at close distances, higher path loss can occur due to environmental factors, as shown in table \ref{tab:path_loss_exponent}'s path loss exponent.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/research_results/path-loss-lab.png}
      \captionof{figure}{Path loss for lab location.}
      \label{fig:path_loss_lab}
  \end{minipage}\hfill
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/research_results/path-loss-home.png}
      \captionof{figure}{Path loss for hoome location.}
      \label{fig:path_loss_home}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Free space environments, such as satellite communication, typically exhibit lower path loss, while indoor locations like homes tend to experience higher path loss due to the presence of obstacles, such as walls and furniture \cite{cho2010mimo}. The plots confirm the expected relationship between path loss, distance, and environment.

The first plot, representing the lab location, displays lower path loss between devices. This can be attributed to the controlled environment and shorter distances between devices. In contrast, the second plot, showcasing the home location, reveals higher path loss between devices. This increase in path loss can be attributed to both the larger distances between devices and the presence of obstacles in the home environment, which impede wireless communication signals.


\section{Algorithmic Parameter Analysis}

So far, the analyses for MCM and GA have been based on the applied values to the experimental prototype, with the only differing parameter being the distance between the two different locations, lab and home. The previous experiments provided valuable insights into the performance of both algorithms within the tested parameters. However, it is also important to explore their behavior with different parameters and larger distances for a more comprehensive understanding. To achieve this, a parameter table has been created using the following imaginary values:

\begin{longtable}{>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.504\linewidth}>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.367\linewidth}}
  \label{tab:algorithmic_parameter_analysis}\\
  \caption{Algorithmic parameter analysis.}\\
  \hline\hline
  Parameter        & Value       \endfirsthead
  \hline
  $d$              & 10~$m$       \\
  $D_0$            & 0.35~$m$    \\
  $n$              & 6.0         \\
  $\sigma$         & 5.0~$dB$    \\
  Population size  & 30          \\
  Max iteration    & 20          \\
  Mutation rate    & 0.3         \\
  Selection method & Tournament  \\
  Mutation method  & Random      \\
  \hline\hline
\end{longtable}

These parameters are described in tables \ref{tab:monte_carlo_parameters} and \ref{tab:ga_parameters}. Although increasing the distance would impact the number of devices and the computational power required for the MCM, the chosen distance represents a reasonable compromise for the given number of devices. In response to the sub-research question 5, the tables below present the MCM and GA outputs based on these different parameters, demonstrating how the algorithms behave under different conditions and larger distances:

\begin{longtable}{>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.327\linewidth}>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.452\linewidth}>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.14\linewidth}}
  \label{tab:mcm_different_parameter_analysis}\\
  \caption{Monte Carlo Method output based on different parameters.}\\

  \hline
  3, 4, 5, 5, 3, 2, 2, 2 & -12, -12, 8, 4, -4, -16, -4, 8 & 0        \\
  \hline\hline
\end{longtable}

\begin{longtable}{>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.356\linewidth}>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.452\linewidth}>{\hspace{0pt}}m{0.104\linewidth}}
  \label{tab:ga_different_parameter_analysis}\\
  \caption{Genetic Algorithm output based on different parameters.}\\
  \hline\hline
  Device                 & $P_{tx} (dBm)$               & Total  \endfirsthead
  \hline
  5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2 & -11, -12, -9, 8, 6, -4, 5, 7 & -10    \\
  \hline\hline
\end{longtable}

While the MCM table may not show any significant differences compared to previous analyses, the transmission power from the GA table does present interesting observations. Upon closer inspection, the transmission power is no longer at the edge range, as seen in past analyses. This outcome is expected since the current transmission power is calculated from much larger distances, while the past analyses were based on closer distances. In smaller distances, lower transmission power values are sufficient to maintain a reliable connection between devices, as the signal propagation is stronger. On the other hand, larger distances require higher transmission power values to ensure the signal can effectively reach and maintain a stable connection with other devices in the network.

In the context of the GA plot for transmission power optimization, the optimization line is no longer linear, likely due to the different parameters used, especially the selection method. The max value reaches a high of 5901 $dBm$ but drops to -17 $dBm$ at the lowest point, a notable result. The Y-axis, which shows the transmission power made up of both penalties for each constraint violation and the output transmission power for each iteration from GA, is understandably higher. Even though the plot reached -17 $dBm$, the best transmission power is the one with no penalty, as shown by the GA output in the table.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/research_results/genetic_algorithm_different_parameter_power.png}

  \end{minipage}\hfill
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}

      \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/research_results/path-loss-different-parameter.png}
      \captionof{figure}{Path loss based on different parameters for large distance.}
      \label{fig:path_loss_different_parameter}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

In addition to the impact on transmission power, the different parameters also affect path loss. The path loss plot, based on these different network parameters, shows a much higher path loss value as expected. This higher path loss is in line with the trend observed in past analyses, where path loss increased with higher distances. While distance is the primary contributor to these changes, other factors, such as the variance of components $\sigma$, reference distance $d$, and the signal power decay with distance in the path loss model $n$, also play a role. The path loss figure \ref{fig:path_loss_different_parameter} demonstrates these differences, providing valuable insights into how the various parameters influence path loss in different scenarios.


\section{Experimental Data Analysis}

The following analysis delves into a comprehensive data table that compares two distinct modes of operation in communication systems. The primary focus of this data table is to evaluate the current consumption of each mode, with the ultimate goal of identifying the more efficient method for power conservation. To accomplish this, an array of different parameters are considered. The subsequent sections provide an in-depth examination and interpretation of the data, aiming to answer the research questions and offer valuable insights into power optimization strategies.

In the analysis of the table \ref{tab:experimental_data_analysis}, a detailed comparison between the maximum and optimized modes can be made, taking into account various parameters, including the mean, max, and min current values, location, iteration, and device type. Here is a more comprehensive overview of the data:


\subsection{Mean, Max, and Min Current Analysis}

The analysis of the mean, max, and min current $(mA)$ across all devices, locations, and methods revealed various trends. Overall, the mean current values ranged from 6.19 $mA$ to 11.98 $mA$, with the lowest values observed in the BR series devices and the highest values in the ED series devices. The maximum current values varied from 12.6 $mA$ to 22.64 $mA$, while the minimum current values were between 0.25 $mA$ and 7.53 $mA$. This broad range of values suggests that different devices, methods, and environments may have significant impacts on the current consumption of the devices tested.


\subsection{Location-Specific Analysis}

The location-specific analysis demonstrated that the devices' performance differed depending on whether they were tested in a lab or at home. In general, the mean, max, and min current values were higher in the lab setting compared to the home setting. This could be attributed to the controlled environment in the lab, which may have led to more stable and consistent performance across devices. This finding answer sub-research question 9, which aims to investigate the impact of location on power optimization performance.


\subsection{Iteration-Specific Analysis}

In comparing the first and second iterations, it was observed that the mean, max, and min current values showed little variation. This indicates that the performance of the devices was consistent across both iterations. However, some minor differences were noticed, such as a slight increase or decrease in the current values for some devices between iterations. This could be due to the variations in the environment or the devices' behavior during the testing period. This analysis answers sub-research question 6, which aims to explore the differences in power optimization performance between different iterations for both maximum and optimized modes.


\subsection{Device-Specific Analysis}

The device-specific analysis revealed that the BR series devices consistently exhibited the lowest mean, max, and min current values compared to the R and ED series devices. In contrast, the ED series devices had the highest mean, max, and min current values. This suggests that the BR series devices may be more energy-efficient than the other devices, while the ED series devices may require more power to operate. This finding answer sub-research question 7, which aims to compare the power optimization performance of different devices in Maximum and Optimized modes.


\subsection{Type-Specific Analysis}

When comparing devices with no sensor versus devices with a ping, it was found that devices without a sensor tended to have slightly lower mean, max, and min current values. This indicates that the presence of a sensor may increase power consumption in certain devices.

Further investigation into this finding revealed that devices with sensors require additional power to operate the sensor and transmit sensor data, leading to increased power consumption. In contrast, devices without sensors do not have these additional power requirements, resulting in lower power consumption overall.


\subsection{Mode-Specific Analysis}

The mode-specific analysis revealed that the devices' performance was affected by the MCM and GA modes. In general, the mean, max, and min current values were higher in the MCM mode compared to the GA mode. This suggests that the MCM mode require more power to operate and maintain, while the GA mode may offer more energy-efficient performance.

Furthermore, when comparing the power optimization performance of the MCM and GA modes, it was found that the GA mode outperformed the MCM mode in terms of energy efficiency. Devices operating in the GA mode consumed less power while still achieving comparable levels of performance, indicating that this mode may be a better option for power optimization. This finding supports the sub-research question 10 on the effect of mode on power optimization, indicating that the choice of mode can have a significant impact on power consumption and optimization performance.


\subsection{Method-Specific Analysis}

Lastly, the method-specific analysis showed that the mean, max, and min current values were lower in the optimized method compared to the maximum method. This indicates that the optimized method may provide a more energy-efficient solution for the devices tested, as it consumes less power overall. This insight could prove useful when selecting a method for future deployments to reduce energy consumption and improve device performance. This finding answer sub-research question 8, which aims to explore the correlation between mean, max, and min current values and the efficiency of power optimization for different methods.

\vspace{3mm}
In conclusion, the data analysis of the mean, max, and min current values across various parameters, including iteration, device type, location, sensor presence, mode, and method, revealed distinct trends in the devices' power consumption. The BR series devices consistently showed the lowest current values, suggesting better energy efficiency compared to other device types. Devices tested in the lab displayed higher current values than those in the home setting, indicating the influence of environmental factors on device power consumption.

Furthermore, devices without sensors generally consumed less power, and the GA mode demonstrated lower current values compared to the MCM mode. Finally, the optimized method appeared to be a more energy-efficient solution compared to the maximum method.


\section{Experimental Results}

In this section, the power efficiency of the devices under study is examined, focusing on the maximum and optimized methods applied to MCM and GA modes. The analysis considers the error values obtained from the first and second iteration MCM and GA values, providing insights into the variability and precision of the measurements. This results-driven perspective allows for a comprehensive understanding of the performance differences between the methods and modes under investigation.

The table \ref{tab:experimental_results} presents a comprehensive comparison of MCM and GA modes in the Optimized method, with a focus on the percentage values calculated from the maximum current values obtained in previous analyses. Considering the maximum current values for the power optimization process is important because it helps identify the devices' peak current usage. This method offers a clearer understanding of the devices' power efficiency in different modes and iterations. By focusing on the highest current values, a more accurate assessment of the effectiveness of the power optimization process can be achieved, especially during the most demanding situations. This approach addresses the sub-research question 11, which aims to understand the impact of power optimization methods on devices' power efficiency across different modes and iterations.

In the optimized method, the lab location exhibits a higher percentage for no sensor and ping types in both MCM and GA modes when compared to the home location. Specifically, for the no sensor type, the lab location has a 25.69\% and 26.42\% improvement in MCM and GA modes, respectively, in the first iteration, while for the ping type, the lab location has an 18.52\% and 27.07\% improvement in MCM and GA modes, respectively. In the second iteration, the lab location maintains its higher performance with 20.6\% and 26.31\% improvements in MCM and GA modes for the no sensor type, and 18.39\% and 28.47\% improvements in MCM and GA modes for the ping type. This observation indicates that the devices in the lab location demonstrate better power efficiency.

On the other hand, in the home location, the no sensor type shows a 27.12\% and 25.92\% improvement in MCM and GA modes, respectively, in the first iteration, while for the ping type, there is a 19.24\% and 26.19\% improvement in MCM and GA modes, respectively. In the second iteration, the home location has a 24.38\% and 24.25\% improvement in MCM and GA modes for the no sensor type, and 24.84\% and 27.47\% improvements in MCM and GA modes for the ping type.

Errors were calculated based on the differences between the first and second iteration values for MCM and GA modes. The presence of errors might be attributed to various factors, such as device inconsistencies, environmental factors, or potential limitations in the experimental setup. These errors affect the research by introducing a level of uncertainty in the results, making it necessary to interpret the findings with caution, which addresses the second sub-research question 12. For instance, in the lab location, the no sensor type has errors of 5.09\% and 0.11\% in MCM and GA modes, while in the home location, errors are 2.74\% and 1.67\% for the same modes.

In conclusion, the analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of parameter optimization in developing a power-optimized Thread mesh wireless network, addressing the main research question and the problem definition. Both MCM and GA modes outperform the maximum method, with GA optimization consistently offering better optimization results than MCM across different locations and device types. This indicates that the GA approach significantly contributes to lowering power consumption in Thread mesh wireless networks by optimizing transmission power parameter more effectively than the MCM method.

The algorithmic approach, specifically the GA optimization, can be integrated into the system by adjusting transmission power parameter according to the optimization results. By monitoring the network conditions and transmission power, the Thread mesh wireless network can maintain optimal energy efficiency. The results provide a solid foundation for future exploration and enhancements in power optimization using algorithmic approaches, addressing the challenges of consuming higher power, ultimately realizing the full potential of Thread-based wireless communication in a wide range of low-powered IoT network fields.
