\chapter{Research Results}\label{chap:research_results}

In the chapter discussing your research results you must provide all the results of your research in tables, graphs and figures format. Compare your results with the results found in literature or previous research and include all falsifications that you are aware of. Also comparisons must be made with the hypothesis you stated in the second chapter: are they correct? If so, why? If not, why not?
This chapter should include all the information that came out of your research and it should include a critical interpretation of these results.
